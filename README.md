# Disposable Shiny Apps

Companion repo for my posit::conf(2025) talk on building short-lived, high-impact Shiny apps for demos and meetings.

## Why it matters
- Swap static slides for interactive conversations.
- Build deliberately temporary apps that take hours, not weeks.
- Lean on AI assistants and lightweight styling to keep momentum high.

## Explore the examples
- `app.R`: live demo app shown during the session.
- `posit-conf-2025.qmd`: source for the talk visuals and code snippets.
- `media/`: screenshots and short clips used in the presentation.

## Try it yourself
1. Open `app.R` in RStudio (or your preferred IDE).
2. Install packages if prompted, then click Run App.
3. Fork the layout, swap the data, and ship your own disposable app.
