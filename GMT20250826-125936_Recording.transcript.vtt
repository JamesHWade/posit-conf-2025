571
01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:56.320
Alright, James, it is your turn, sir.

572
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.280
James Wade: Alright.

573
01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:01.189
James Wade: My computer's using way too much RAM, so I'm gonna close a couple things.

574
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.990
James Wade: Macs aren't supposed to have this problem.

575
01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:11.189
Blythe Coons: Mine often says I'm doing too much, and I'm sure I'm doing way less than you.

576
01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:15.110
James Wade: It's just, I'm lazy about closing things.

577
01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:32.860
James Wade: Okay, so as far as feedback goes, I think what I'm after is two things. I have not added… I've had, like, there's plenty of styling in this, but I haven't added, images, to it, like, salient images that might be… so if you have any suggestions for that, but maybe more importantly.

578
01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:42.800
James Wade: I want to get a sense of pace, because I want to know if what I'm saying already feels obvious, and I should just get to, like, the kind of demo tips and tricks portion of it.

579
01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:43.680
Blythe Coons: Okay.

580
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:46.950
Blythe Coons: I'll keep an eye on time for different sections.

581
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:57.569
James Wade: Okay. All right, hi everybody. I am here today to tell you about Shiny Apps, but before I talk about what I mean by that, I first want to tell you my goals for today.

582
01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.929
James Wade: Fundamentally, my goal for today is to convince you is that you should build more shiny apps, And then…

583
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.080
James Wade: I want you to throw them away.

584
01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:15.199
James Wade: So, who am I to say this? So, my name is James Wade, and I build lots and lots of shiny apps.

585
01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:30.620
James Wade: I know both sides of this. So, the deep production side, I have a 2-year-old Shiny app that has over 500 active users. It has tests as part of it, CICD pipelines, it has a development backlog that continues to grow by the day, it seems.

586
01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:37.199
James Wade: And so I know the pain that can come from the longevity, but also, of course, the value of having a long-living, shiny application.

587
01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:38.949
James Wade: On the other side of this.

588
01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:47.140
James Wade: I build lots of apps that I throw away. I'll build something for an individual meeting, maybe it needs to stay alive for an hour or so.

589
01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:59.689
James Wade: And then it can die gracefully, or more likely, just water up Closet Connect. But I do know the power of the immediacy of having an application when otherwise you wouldn't normally have something that you can go and interact with.

590
01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:16.520
James Wade: Let's think about more of the motivation here and the frustration that I imagine many of you have seen. So you put together a finely crafted presentation, you present your analysis, you have these polished slides, and then a stakeholder comes to you and says.

591
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:26.449
James Wade: that's really interesting, but what if we looked at the data this way? What if we filtered by year, or looked at this by quarter, or what if I added some more data to this?

592
01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.920
James Wade: And… Your answer is, I'll have to get back to you on that.

593
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:37.349
James Wade: You've sort of stopped the conversation, or the momentum, or maybe even the excitement has been lost.

594
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:40.740
James Wade: Depending on you to then go back and follow up later on.

595
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:50.600
James Wade: I want to come back, or I want to start, use an analogy here, to think about going into a museum.

596
01:03:50.740 --> 01:04:02.270
James Wade: So, I have 3 young kids. We spend lots of time at kids' museums, which, if you haven't been to one recently, is basically an indoor playground that has lots of fun, interactive,

597
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:12.839
James Wade: components to it. It has hand-on exploration, you really can actively discover things, you can probably catch a few diseases from all the other kids that are playing around, and it really invites you… it's an inviting

598
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:28.200
James Wade: fun place to be. If you contrast this with an art museum, this is a place where, you know, you feel like maybe you should go. It's… you're not gonna take kids there, but it's a place where you can enjoy the aesthetics and really appreciate true beauty for well-crafted consideration.

599
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:35.740
James Wade: it has a passive component to it, and it really is creating a single perspective. And if you contrast these to an app.

600
01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:50.850
James Wade: or if you extend this analogy to go to a Shiny app, you know, the art museum here is asking your attendees to maybe step back from the data and listen to you. You're not really inviting them in, whereas the kids' museum is saying, hey, come play with this. I want you to come and explore.

601
01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:58.980
James Wade: And if you think about this, which room, or, you know, here, which presentation is going to have more energy and excitement that's a part of it?

602
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.960
James Wade: Well…

603
01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:08.710
James Wade: Maybe this seems obvious, that yes, if you can have an interactive application, that this would be your preference, but

604
01:05:08.850 --> 01:05:14.230
James Wade: Why aren't we writing more shiny apps? Why aren't we having more interactive tools that people can use?

605
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:19.679
James Wade: I think this comes down to two traps. The first is the… what I'll call the don't-build-it trap.

606
01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:37.710
James Wade: it ends up being… it feels like it's way too much effort to build an application for one meeting. We fall back to working on slides because we think that climbing this development hill is going to be a bit too steep. The second trap that we may fall into is, yeah, you decide, yeah, I'm going to go build an application for this.

607
01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:54.649
James Wade: And then you turn around and it's been a week, and you have a nice application, but, you know, you're behind on all your other work. You think that, yeah, if I build this, it's got to be some sort of production-grade capability, I need to think about users, and maybe you end up over-engineering a solution that really should have been a one-off need.

608
01:05:54.770 --> 01:06:05.660
James Wade: And the result of both of these traps is that we end up having death by PowerPoint. We end up going, falling back to slides when maybe this interactive modality would end up being better for us.

609
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.890
James Wade: So this brings us to this idea of the disposable shiny app.

610
01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:22.790
James Wade: And what I'm… what I want you to think about here is, and instead of building slides, what if it was as easy to build an application for an individual meeting as it was to build the entire slide deck?

611
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:30.200
James Wade: The value here is to have an immediate impact, not focusing on longevity.

612
01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:45.910
James Wade: And we need to change our thinking a little bit here about… of an application where it's more of a communication artifact or a communication tool, not a production system that people are going to rely upon. And of course, it's designed to be tossed away.

613
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:53.109
James Wade: One other way to think about this, it's a whiteboard sketch, not a monument.

614
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:55.780
James Wade: So…

615
01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:10.529
James Wade: I'll caveat this a little bit by saying I mean this a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but there is a game changer here that can revolutionize our approach to this, specifically if you're looking at this talk and you're thinking it's way too much effort for us to climb this development hill.

616
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:13.589
James Wade: And this is vibe coding. Now.

617
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:37.460
James Wade: I mostly mean this as a joke, and I'll continue to mean it as a joke until I don't anymore, but you can think of this as you can use these plain English prompts, where you can take that, an idea, and you can turn this into something close to a functional shiny application in just a few seconds using a capability like Copilot, or maybe the Positron Assistant that I'm highly anticipating is going to be highlighted at PositCuff, and will probably

618
01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.550
James Wade: Probably had been highlighted before this talk.

619
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:50.579
James Wade: You can go and you can put this… oh, this… well, this did not render appropriately, but the idea here is to have a prompt and then, show some code, that… that's… that… that's coming out of this.

620
01:07:50.580 --> 01:08:00.350
James Wade: And in particular, a disposable shiny application really fits this quite well, of taking an idea and having a Shiny upcoming at the end.

621
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:12.829
James Wade: So let's think about how you can go about building this particular type of shiny application, and I want to do this by building an app called the Chaos… the Cat Chaos Coordinator.

622
01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:17.109
James Wade: Importantly, what we want to do with this is start with a question.

623
01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:30.079
James Wade: You want to really understand the intent going into this application, and it really should only be one. If you're trying to answer multiple questions with this, the application is likely going to get you to a level of more complexity.

624
01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:50.060
James Wade: So, I might… I don't… I haven't looked at the time that I'm doing here. This is gonna go through kind of a more detailed step through this, and this… the application itself is going to change. So, I'm going to mostly skip through this portion, and maybe, if I have time, go through a couple of the objections, and then I'll… then maybe stop.

625
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:52.159
Blythe Coons: You're at 6.45 right now.

626
01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:53.019
James Wade: Okay

627
01:08:53.249 --> 01:09:01.329
James Wade: So, I want to directly address some of the objections that some of you may have, or some of the questions that you may have going into this.

628
01:09:01.449 --> 01:09:14.149
James Wade: The first of which is, who's gonna support this? I get this question all the time. What's the maintenance plan? Who's gonna be the owner of this thing? Let's remember, nobody's gonna support this. That's the entire point of this.

629
01:09:14.249 --> 01:09:30.269
James Wade: You don't need… you don't need to have a maintenance crew for a whiteboard drawing. You can just totally erase this away. If the application took 15 minutes to build again, and somebody decides that they want it, well, you know, you have 15 minutes. You can go… just go and rebuild it. And honestly, if it does…

630
01:09:30.329 --> 01:09:36.499
James Wade: becomes something longer term, then that's going to be a different project and is no longer serving the purpose of a shiny application.

631
01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:50.359
James Wade: Second thing you might be thinking, especially if you are in a larger company where you're heavy users of tools like Positive Connect, is isn't this going to create a bunch of apps for all, where you already have a cluttered dashboard and nobody knows how to find anything?

632
01:09:50.599 --> 01:09:51.399
James Wade: Well…

633
01:09:51.899 --> 01:10:05.819
James Wade: Yeah, probably, and I'll tell you that I'm probably not the right person to provide advice for this, because I've been accused of myself of becoming an application hoarder. I have way too many of these capabilities, because I like them, and they're relatively easy to keep existing on there.

634
01:10:06.159 --> 01:10:23.259
James Wade: But again, let's think of the mentality here. You probably don't even need to deploy something that's going to be used for this disposable application. You're creating a communication artifact, not this production system, and so part of the mental shift that you need to go through here is committing to actually throwing the app away.

635
01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:34.789
James Wade: Lastly, maybe you're thinking, this sounds like too much work. You're probably still going to have to go in, and create slides, so is this really going to be faster?

636
01:10:35.019 --> 01:10:52.349
James Wade: you know, I've done this myself and go and think through how much does this take me if I'm going to go and build one of these capabilities, and usually it can be an entire workday, dedicated to go building an application that sometimes I feel just doesn't have the impact that I want. It doesn't have any interactivity.

637
01:10:52.349 --> 01:11:09.109
James Wade: And I've gotten to the point, heavily leveraging these AI capabilities, a la Posit Assistant, to go and create an interactive application in under an hour. And if you don't believe me of how quickly these can be, I really want to challenge you to go and try this yourself.

638
01:11:09.109 --> 01:11:18.729
James Wade: The overall… so the impact-to-effort ratio that you can think about here is going to be really high, and let's be honest, it's way more fun to tinker with a Shiny application than it is to go

639
01:11:18.729 --> 01:11:19.949
James Wade: Tinker with slides.

640
01:11:21.329 --> 01:11:22.259
James Wade: ….

641
01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.630
Blythe Coons: We're gonna pause you there, if that's okay.

642
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:24.970
James Wade: Yep, yep, yep.

643
01:11:24.970 --> 01:11:25.720
Blythe Coons: Okay, great.

644
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:34.120
James Wade: This is… and this is the kind of closing challenge that I have, is I just want them to, you know, go do it, is sort of the call to… call to action that I have.

645
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:37.549
Blythe Coons: Great. Awesome. Thanks, James. How did that feel?

646
01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:44.019
James Wade: It felt okay. I had… oh, that link is wrong. …

647
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:51.999
James Wade: Yeah, it's… I don't know. I'm excited about the topic, so I kind of have fun talking through it. One…

648
01:11:52.980 --> 01:12:00.179
James Wade: The museum analogy, I liked creating it, but felt kind of clunky, so I'd like feedback on how people felt about that.

649
01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:01.230
Blythe Coons: Okay.

650
01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.000
James Wade: … Yeah, felt pretty good.

651
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:15.699
Blythe Coons: So, first things first. Things that you liked about James's talk, things that were sticky, takeaways, only positives, no recommendations yet.

652
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.480
Charlie Gao: the… The way you described the…

653
01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:24.129
Charlie Gao: Shiny app as a communication artifact?

654
01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:30.079
Charlie Gao: I thought that was super important, and I don't know if you've come back to that topic, but I felt…

655
01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:34.880
Charlie Gao: That was, you know… If people took nothing out.

656
01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:39.330
Charlie Gao: Nothing else out of your presentation? Just that would be…

657
01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:43.259
Charlie Gao: That's super important, in my opinion.

658
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:46.659
Charlie Gao: I'm really glad you picked up on it.

659
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:58.130
Blythe Coons: James, I like that too. And you… you equate it to a whiteboard sketch. I thought, is it like a post-it note as well? Like, something that.

660
01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.050
James Wade: I like that.

661
01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:10.080
Blythe Coons: post-it note doesn't take as long as a whiteboard sketch, but I think of this as such a throwaway thing, as opposed to something that is erased.

662
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:13.059
Blythe Coons: I don't know.

663
01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:18.549
Blythe Coons: Claudia, something you liked from James's talk.

664
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:23.509
Claudia Penaloza: I love the analogy of the art museum versus the kids' museum.

665
01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:32.800
Claudia Penaloza: I'm not supposed to give any recommendations now, so I'm not gonna say anything else. Let me see what else I thought was really cool.

666
01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:41.319
Claudia Penaloza: … Yeah, just focusing on that interactivity, and actually, like.

667
01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.019
Claudia Penaloza: Death by PowerPoint is a thing.

668
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:52.519
Claudia Penaloza: And if you… if you can actually interact with your… with the people who are listening to you, I think it's much…

669
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:56.349
Claudia Penaloza: Easier, more effective way to getting

670
01:13:56.900 --> 01:14:03.129
Claudia Penaloza: the information that you're trying to show, getting that information across. I think it's….

671
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:17.100
Blythe Coons: So you got a vote for your art museum versus kids' museum. And, you know, James, I have a lot of positive things in my notes. I also like the Death by Power point. I also like the

672
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:28.919
Blythe Coons: communications artifact. I like how you are structuring it, like, the titles of the slides, the universal frustration, here are the two traps, these sorts of things. I think you take us through it really clearly.

673
01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:41.420
Blythe Coons: I wanna… I wanna share with you some times that I clocked. So, you got to the disposable app at about 4 minutes, 18 seconds.

674
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:47.080
Blythe Coons: You were at Traps by 3 minutes and 12.

675
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:49.020
James Wade: Okay.

676
01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.640
Blythe Coons: So…

677
01:14:50.990 --> 01:15:02.949
Blythe Coons: you know, I would normally want you to be at your disposable app by 3, 3.30, but I think that the traps are a really important part of the context here.

678
01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:16.270
Blythe Coons: The art museum, kids' museum, does take, like, over a minute to explain as an analogy, but I think it's relevant.

679
01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:26.529
James Wade: What about… so, I was going through the points, and I felt like, I was like, oh, maybe I don't need these. Do you think images of museums might make this more… yeah.

680
01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:34.600
Claudia Penaloza: That was gonna be my recommendation, like, a picture of a whole bunch of, you know, crusty adults staring at pictures.

681
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:42.219
Claudia Penaloza: You know, art, whatever, and then the kids just, like, climbing over everything and stuff, and yeah, would definitely be….

682
01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:43.310
Blythe Coons: And James.

683
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:46.750
Charlie Gao: Can I just say that I didn't get that analogy at all?

684
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:51.090
Charlie Gao: No, not at all. I mean, I just, like, it didn't resonate with me.

685
01:15:51.810 --> 01:15:52.939
Claudia Penaloza: Do you have kids?

686
01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:54.920
Charlie Gao: No.

687
01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.130
Blythe Coons: I actually.

688
01:15:56.130 --> 01:15:57.090
Claudia Penaloza: That might be the reason.

689
01:15:57.090 --> 01:16:04.480
Blythe Coons: I think the images, James, will be really helpful here, right? Like, a ball pit, or whatever you have at a kid's museum, versus.

690
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:04.810
James Wade: Yeah.

691
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:18.159
Blythe Coons: a bunch of people staring at a Whistler, and like, you know, how stodgy it can be. I would take all the words off that slide, except maybe the final point, where, like, data, it should be fun, versus… Yep.

692
01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:29.839
Blythe Coons: Yep. And just do images, and one and two images. And I would actually reverse it. So you had kids on the right, you had art museum on the left. Because you're gonna talk about kids first, bring in kids first on the left.

693
01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.139
James Wade: Yep, okay.

694
01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:44.169
James Wade: So, Charlie, just to make this explicit, I mean, I make sure this is making sense, is that the idea is that you're touching things at a kid's museum, whereas you can't touch anything in an art museum. You have to stand back and look at the painting.

695
01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:46.640
James Wade: Versus, like, click around on a shiny app.

696
01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.469
Charlie Gao: Yeah, the reason I'm hesitant is that it makes it seem that it…

697
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:58.750
Charlie Gao: you know, it makes it seem that the Shiny app is in some way less serious, or….

698
01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.740
James Wade: ….

699
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:00.129
Charlie Gao: You know.

700
01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:01.380
James Wade: Okay.

701
01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:04.200
Charlie Gao: And that was what I got from it.

702
01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:04.860
James Wade: Yeah.

703
01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:10.469
Charlie Gao: That is, in some way, … Yeah, less consequential, rather, yeah.

704
01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:14.840
James Wade: Yeah, that's helpful feedback, because I think I can… I think I can explain it a little bit better.

705
01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:19.959
James Wade: Same thing might be true of the post-it note analogy, as it feels like it less….

706
01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:21.640
Charlie Gao: I mean, again, I mean…

707
01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:27.530
Charlie Gao: I mean, sort of this concept of, you know, sort of people looking at sort of like a crusty whistler, I mean.

708
01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:34.140
Charlie Gao: that's not my typical, like, experience of art museums. Like, I'm very into my art, but there's, like.

709
01:17:35.370 --> 01:17:39.840
Charlie Gao: Yeah. So… Yeah, I don't know. I mean, it just…

710
01:17:40.190 --> 01:17:46.700
Charlie Gao: didn't… to me, it just didn't really work that well, but I understand what you're aiming for.

711
01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:52.360
James Wade: Okay, I'll think more on that, of how to deliver that, because I also love art museums.

712
01:17:52.580 --> 01:18:01.160
James Wade: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with Whistler, by the way. It's… I think the… I think the through line there is that it's, …

713
01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:20.489
James Wade: it depends on your intent, right? There might be a time where you want to have a really polished story, like, you know, you don't want to be interrupted when you're telling this… giving this slide, and that could be true for a shiny application demo as well, where, like, it's a really consequential scenario, so that's a…

714
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:22.420
James Wade: Yeah, thanks for that feedback.

715
01:18:25.370 --> 01:18:29.599
Blythe Coons: Other recommendations? I think, Claudia, you had a couple on your list.

716
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:34.960
Claudia Penaloza: … Yes, I was gonna… there… okay, so…

717
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:38.810
Claudia Penaloza: Hadley presented a keynote at Uzar.

718
01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:46.379
Claudia Penaloza: And during his keynote, he exemplified how fast an AI can build a shiny app.

719
01:18:46.570 --> 01:18:55.329
Claudia Penaloza: And not only with prompting, like, not only just, you know, verbally asking the…

720
01:18:56.120 --> 01:19:04.500
Claudia Penaloza: the LLM to do something, you can draw the Shiny app And it will… code…

721
01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:06.799
Claudia Penaloza: According to the drawing that you gave it.

722
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.610
Claudia Penaloza: So….

723
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:08.250
James Wade: Right.

724
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:11.670
Claudia Penaloza: I'm pretty sure you can watch his keynote if you want.

725
01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:14.660
James Wade: I've seen it, yeah, it's… I liked it a lot, yeah.

726
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:15.250
Claudia Penaloza: No.

727
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:24.169
Claudia Penaloza: So even, like, even easier than you describing what you want the app to do, you draw the app, and it will make it for you, which I thought.

728
01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:27.030
James Wade: You under… you underestimate how bad of an artist I am.

729
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.770
Claudia Penaloza: Well, I mean, you can draw a square, come on.

730
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:32.430
James Wade: True, true.

731
01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:43.730
Charlie Gao: Yeah, I'm guessing most people at PosiConf will be quite receptive to the subject, so you probably don't need to be too apologetic in sort of, you know, vibe coding or sort of, you know…

732
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.860
Charlie Gao: Having to couch those turns so much.

733
01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:56.020
James Wade: I think what I… so the… so here's something that I, for my last session, I was wanting to make sure we… I got through, was,

734
01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:04.559
James Wade: The case of vibe coding that I don't want people to do is that you don't get to skip the careful consideration of the message you're trying to communicate.

735
01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:09.050
James Wade: just because you're creating an app. And so that's what I want, like, that's…

736
01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:17.479
James Wade: I think it'll come through in the demo of… of how to… how you create this, and how you're putting that thought into

737
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:20.130
James Wade: your prompt, basically. ….

738
01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.410
Charlie Gao: I think that's all the point.

739
01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:22.409
James Wade: how to communicate.

740
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:30.080
Charlie Gao: That sounds… that sounds fine, yeah. I just didn't want you to feel that, you know, that there might be sort of hostility in the room, like, I don't….

741
01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.340
James Wade: Sure.

742
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:37.300
James Wade: 2024, there might have been. Yeah. Yeah.

743
01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.899
Charlie Gao: So, you know, you have….

744
01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.730
James Wade: When you have Hadley and Joe standing….

745
01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:49.309
Charlie Gao: Even Hadley's talk at Yuzar, you know, that audience would traditionally be a bit more cautious, but, you know, the reception to his talk was fantastic.

746
01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:51.389
James Wade: Oh, that's great to hear, yeah.

747
01:20:53.170 --> 01:21:04.239
Blythe Coons: One of the only recommendations I have for you, and you're doing a great job of building the slides, you know, you've done this before, James, but for your…

748
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:07.960
Blythe Coons: Production and disposable slide, which was pretty early.

749
01:21:08.650 --> 01:21:14.099
Blythe Coons: I would break apart those two comparisons, and I wouldn't bring in disposable until you've finished with

750
01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.300
Blythe Coons: Production, because otherwise people are going to be reading ahead.

751
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:22.010
James Wade: Okay. Do you mean have it on a separate slide, or just wait to do the build?

752
01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:31.189
Blythe Coons: wait to do the build, because you brought them in both really quickly at this, like, so I was looking at disposable the whole time you were talking about production, and I just want you to wait until you're ready to talk about it.

753
01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.360
James Wade: Gotcha.

754
01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:45.360
Blythe Coons: And then for your link at the end, even if it's incorrect, when you get it corrected, I would give a QR code. Hadley is encouraging as many QR codes as possible, just to make it really easy to snap a picture of.

755
01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:48.310
James Wade: Cool.

756
01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:57.519
Claudia Penaloza: I have a question, and I don't know if I'm supposed to say anything about this. You had a lot of different colored backgrounds.

757
01:21:58.460 --> 01:22:03.269
Claudia Penaloza: is… You saw my slides, mine are, like…

758
01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:07.410
Claudia Penaloza: two-toned, so I'm obviously on the other end.

759
01:22:07.940 --> 01:22:19.349
Blythe Coons: And again, every single person's aesthetic is different, and there's no right or wrong about backgrounds or… I mean, the most important thing, as I said to you, is contrast, and I think we got that with James's.

760
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:27.620
James Wade: If it is, so the one thing I have found jarring is if it is a dark room, and the only time it got dark last year at conf was in, like, the keynote.

761
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:35.110
James Wade: Areas was going from a dark slide to a white background slide, you're, like, hit in the face, and that can be jarring.

762
01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:36.390
Blythe Coons: Right. But most….

763
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:37.919
James Wade: In the room, it's not bad, because it's….

764
01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:40.690
Blythe Coons: Most of the breakout rooms are well lit.

765
01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:51.639
Charlie Gao: Yeah, I wouldn't be worried about that at all. Like, I'm only using the slides I'm using because there's, like, a conf template. Like, most of the time, my slides are just white background.

766
01:22:55.790 --> 01:23:03.689
Blythe Coons: Okay, any other questions or concerns for James, vice versa? James, any other questions you want to ask the audience you have here today?

767
01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:04.860
James Wade: I don't think so.

768
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:15.999
Charlie Gao: Oh, just on… just one tiny point on Positron Assistant, yeah, you can be sure that someone will have mentioned it or something, like, you don't need to sort of, like, I suppose, like, that will be, yeah.

769
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.969
James Wade: I haven't pored over the agenda yet, but I have to… I mean, it's, like, I have it open right now, so, like, it's… it's… it's out, right?

770
01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:23.820
Charlie Gao: Yeah, yeah.

771
01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:25.789
James Wade: That's actually where I'm gonna… the… the…

772
01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:36.150
James Wade: yeah, the prompts that you can use if you want to have a good Shiny app are, like, just go to the Shiny VS Code, you know, GitHub repo, and just take them.

773
01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:43.809
James Wade: Right? It ends up making much better shiny apps. I assume that's going to be built into Posletron's system, too. It's… I can't use it because it's blocked, or Anthropic's blocked.

774
01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:49.580
Charlie Gao: Oh, I see, right, yeah. No, they have, like, a slash command, so you can do, like, slash shiny, and yeah.

775
01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:50.390
James Wade: Oh, awesome.

776
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:52.119
James Wade: Yeah, yeah, I'm excited.

777
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.780
Blythe Coons: Great.

778
01:23:54.930 --> 01:24:09.429
Blythe Coons: Alright, so, what's up next? Some of you know, the next call is the content review. Content review is gonna feel like this session in a lot of different ways… in a lot of ways, because you're gonna give 7 to 10 minutes of your talk.

779
01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:25.699
Blythe Coons: You don't necessarily have to start at the beginning if you want us to hear something new, but it does help us to get a little bit of that setup, and I think if you're retooling the setup just to give it a pass with a different audience is helpful. And then you can skip wherever you want to, doesn't matter.

780
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:41.289
Blythe Coons: We're gonna really control feedback at that point, because we're gonna be one and a half, two weeks out from actual comp, and we don't want to blow up your talk like we did today, like, we won't be reorganizing things, we won't be saying, hey, this doesn't work, like, nothing like that.

781
01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.809
Blythe Coons: What we will be giving feedback on, things that are going really well, so you can feel good about them, put them to bed.

782
01:24:47.190 --> 01:24:49.040
Blythe Coons: Like, move on.

783
01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:54.929
Blythe Coons: Things that are perhaps confusing, so that you can connect the dots for us a little bit more.

784
01:24:55.050 --> 01:25:07.739
Blythe Coons: And then, if there is any jargon, we're gonna turn our ears on for jargon check. I didn't necessarily hear any today, but other audiences will hear different things, and so we just want to make sure that there wasn't any jargon.

785
01:25:08.150 --> 01:25:11.309
Blythe Coons: So that everyone gets a fair shake at understanding.

786
01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:25.490
Blythe Coons: And then we're gonna make sure that your slides are as close to finished as possible. We really do want to see, sort of, how things line up, and we want you to leave that session able to make just a few small tweaks.

787
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:40.930
Blythe Coons: and then get into practicing. So, we won't talk about practicing at this point, because you're still polishing, but when we get there, we'll talk about what the time between that content review and conf should look like and feel like for getting your talk in your body.

788
01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:43.930
Blythe Coons: Any questions for me?

789
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:54.610
Blythe Coons: Alright, then that's all I've got for you today, and I will see you in a couple weeks, one way or another.

790
01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:58.050
Blythe Coons: Thanks so much, everybody, for your help and guidance today.

791
01:25:58.640 --> 01:25:59.740
Claudia Penaloza: Thank you.

792
01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:00.469
James Wade: Hi, everybody.
