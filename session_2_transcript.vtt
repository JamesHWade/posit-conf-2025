1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.399
James Wade: My technical accomplishments of being able to turn my camera on this time.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.050
Articulation Coach: I am very impressive.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.250
Articulation Coach: Well, weren't you on the call where I was also

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.109
Articulation Coach: like on a device for my sound? And my computer was separate.

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.110
Articulation Coach: All.

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.459
James Wade: I don't think so.

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.720
Articulation Coach: I was having. I had zoom issues last week. I feel like the Zoom update bug is getting people.

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:44.249
Articulation Coach: But today the second coaching session is all about outlining and seeing where you are in that process, and hopefully, by the end I can be of support to you to help you feel really confident in that outline before you move to the next phase of the process.

9
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.190
Articulation Coach: So where are you in process, James?

10
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.460
James Wade: So I funny enough. So this is I. I hope you don't pay as much attention to

11
00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.829
James Wade: AI and language models as I do. But Gpt 5 came out today, which is like the very fancy new model from Openai.

12
00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:10.859
James Wade: and so my presentation is probably gonna change a little bit, because it can now do crazy things

13
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.779
James Wade: on its own without me needing to do anything. So I asked it. I I'll just. It'll be easier if I show you it.

14
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.580
Articulation Coach: Sure.

15
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.510
James Wade: So I told it. I was like, Hey, I write a bunch of shiny apps. Impress me.

16
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.779
Articulation Coach: I didn't. That was all. I all I gave it.

17
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.389
James Wade: And it gave me.

18
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.499
James Wade: Did I share? What did I share.

19
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.769
Articulation Coach: I'm seeing your fractal lab right now.

20
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.279
James Wade: Okay, cool. Yeah. So this is what it created. So you can make these little. I don't even know what it does. But this is like super fresh. I just

21
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.329
James Wade: was playing around with this.

22
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.730
James Wade: Maybe I shouldn't have gone up so high. Go back down and

23
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.649
James Wade: well, maybe you can just ignore me because it's okay. There we go.

24
00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:15.119
James Wade: It's creating mathy, generative art.

25
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.429
James Wade: But I guess I thought that I would. I would enjoy that. And like the cool stuff that I can do is, let's see.

26
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.940
James Wade: yeah, saves images and give you a new palette, apparently

27
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.689
James Wade: little slow. So I guess I'll complain. I can complain to it about that.

28
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.409
James Wade: and we can go with. Let's see

29
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.799
James Wade: that one was boring.

30
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.969
James Wade: How about that one?

31
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.260
James Wade: So, anyway?

32
00:02:55.877 --> 00:03:05.719
James Wade: I'm very tempted. I I will have to see how how things go as as it lead up to it. But to see if I can actually create one live

33
00:03:06.773 --> 00:03:11.120
James Wade: with some level of backup. So as a reminder.

34
00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:17.059
James Wade: The talk itself is all about disposable shiny up. So this idea would be something that you create once and throw it away.

35
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.670
Articulation Coach: Yep.

36
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.400
James Wade: And where I'm sitting is, I have

37
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.950
James Wade: okay. So I have the outline and

38
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.979
James Wade: would it be helpful for me to share it or just talk through it.

39
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.830
Articulation Coach: Maybe share it, because then, if I have, because you use a lot of language that I don't recall as quickly. So then I can always recall to your language.

40
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.279
James Wade: Okay. So thinking, here is what I kind of want to get through is.

41
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.979
James Wade: I started doing like timing breakdown for that. But that was like, I don't know. I don't think I'm ready for timing breakdown yet.

42
00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:06.840
James Wade: But I want to

43
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.119
James Wade: get people ex under to understand this idea that I want more shiny apps to exist in the world.

44
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.879
James Wade: And so the basic I'll I'll go through the like. The basic idea that I have for the workflow or the flow for the talk, and then talk a little bit about the hook.

45
00:04:21.752 --> 00:04:37.769
James Wade: So I want to introduce that idea of like disposable, shiny app. I think that's like, you know, people will be interest, hopefully intrigued by the title. And then, yeah, here's kind of say, my goal is, I want you to build more shiny apps and throw them away. I kind of like the surprise of the just throw them away, because that feels like something that we've liked.

46
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.049
James Wade: And we don't want to throw away something. We've grown attached to

47
00:04:43.100 --> 00:05:02.959
James Wade: motivating that by talking about the traps that I think people are gonna get into, which is thinking that it's too much effort to go build something once or the the opposite of where they end up being like, yeah, I'll build this. And then they spend like 40Â h building something that you know, they really should have been doing their day job. Sort of thing.

48
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:17.499
James Wade: I am in a weird situation for the presentation. So I work. I think I shared last time I work at Dow, and Dow is doing terribly as a company right now.

49
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.979
James Wade: which means I am paying out of pocket for the travel.

50
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.299
James Wade: which means, technically, I'm speaking as a as

51
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.829
James Wade: James, not as James research scientist at Dell.

52
00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:42.339
James Wade: The legal ease of that is confusing, but I'm less tethered, but a little bit more constrained in the examples that I give because it shouldn't. It should be something, a talk that I could be able to give outside of my

53
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.520
James Wade: actual job responsibilities.

54
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.429
Articulation Coach: But you can't bring as much.

55
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.930
James Wade: Yeah.

56
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:48.970
Articulation Coach: Example.

57
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.453
James Wade: Yes, but I think I you know

58
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.069
James Wade: I'm not one to follow, to be too overburdened by rules, so

59
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:07.050
James Wade: I I won't try to get myself in trouble. But I'm trying to use this to be more fun with it in a way that somebody in like the Technical Review we have internally might just kind of.

60
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.120
James Wade: you know.

61
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:36.210
James Wade: think is too far. But like this idea of making death by Powerpoint kind of real. And how this is like, hey? You're a data scientist. Don't you really want to be building and writing code building apps and writing code rather than you know, falling into the traps here, actually, I think, are both of these. The fears of this of Don't build and over build the trap is that you end up doing more Powerpoints.

62
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.690
James Wade: I'm like

63
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:44.969
James Wade: nobody's here for that, right? The you want to use them to tell a story, and if an app can tell that story better.

64
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.230
James Wade: then, like, let's build apps.

65
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.620
Articulation Coach: Great.

66
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.549
James Wade: So that is kind of motivating rolling into

67
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.240
James Wade: this next part, which is just to say, like, Okay.

68
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.860
James Wade: the big shift that you need to make is not actually changing the

69
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:13.919
James Wade: approach that you're using. It's changing the mindset because you always could have built these simple apps. But you talked yourself out of them before.

70
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:28.459
James Wade: And even if you did think that they were going to be too much of a time, sync that example that I just showed you of like some cool, generative art type thing that I you know it was a sentence of mine, and then, you know, an app comes out. The other end of it.

71
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.050
Articulation Coach: So.

72
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.469
James Wade: What could you do with that? And I'm thinking this could be a good time for an app demo

73
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.840
James Wade: of.

74
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.439
James Wade: Here's a fun thing that I built just for this conference. I'm gonna throw it away after.

75
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.910
Articulation Coach: Yeah.

76
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.049
James Wade: If I feel super cheeky, maybe I delete the app at the end of the talk. I don't know.

77
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.270
Articulation Coach: I love. I love the drama of that. So that's kind of fun.

78
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:59.070
Articulation Coach: This is going. This is going really well so far feel free to keep going. I'm following really easily.

79
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.750
James Wade: So the next one is to be like kind of nuts and bolts. Of what?

80
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.090
James Wade: How do you do this? Right like? There, I think there are some best practices for this.

81
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.910
James Wade: The 1st is

82
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:17.700
James Wade: the, I think, one comment you had last time. That, I think, is a good one, is to say, you know part of what

83
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:23.709
James Wade: One of the benefits of putting a a presentation together is that it forces you to think through your story.

84
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:35.759
James Wade: I have similarly, one of the apps that I built helps uses generative AI capabilities to help people write reports. Now, these are internal technical boring reports, but some of the critiques I get are that people don't.

85
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.880
James Wade: If I, if you use it, they're not going to discover things they would have through that creation process of writing.

86
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:48.929
James Wade: I think the same thing is true for these presentations. So what does that? What does that come from? So

87
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.360
James Wade: maybe to

88
00:08:50.500 --> 00:09:06.470
James Wade: you? Have a little bit of a contradiction. One way you could have this is to go start making your presentation, and then go land on this this question that you that you want or like, I don't know. Point you really want to bring across. And instead of trying to create a compelling visual, you create an app.

89
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.180
James Wade: The.

90
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.720
Articulation Coach: So it's you then could go.

91
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.800
Articulation Coach: I'm hearing. That's the part you can't shortcut.

92
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.790
James Wade: Yes. Yes.

93
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.880
James Wade: Yeah.

94
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.940
Articulation Coach: That's great!

95
00:09:20.896 --> 00:09:32.359
James Wade: Then there's some like logistical stuff going like, use a template. There's like you can do styling. I'm not gonna like the styling. I'm gonna go over super fast because 2 talks after mine is an entire talk on styling

96
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:38.660
James Wade: using the same approach. And then this is where, like I would like to have

97
00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.079
James Wade: so I'm thinking here of, like the 1st one is

98
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:48.579
James Wade: a cool app that I show the creation process right? So this is where I'm using the new

99
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.610
James Wade: that'll be highlighted at Comp of this positron assistant. And then here is where I want to say, like.

100
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.870
James Wade: here's a demo I.

101
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:05.770
James Wade: The one of one of the ideas we talked about was a cat chaos coordinator. I have 3 kids, so maybe I'll have one about like who has like?

102
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.070
James Wade: Do I feed the cat, or do I feed the baby? I guess they're not babies or 2 now.

103
00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:18.799
James Wade: But I don't know something along those lines of like just make sticking with this. Here's a, you know, throwaway app. That's still fun.

104
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.359
James Wade: Here's so the next part kind of

105
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.529
James Wade: right before what I'm thinking of as a call to action is

106
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.170
James Wade: the what anticipating the objections that people have like who's gonna support this

107
00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:41.809
James Wade: where you know the cheeky thing of, you know I built this while we were talking. So why do you care about who's gonna report it, or support it.

108
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:47.679
James Wade: or a point about, are we gonna just be like

109
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.979
James Wade: people are already in dashboard. Hell, are we gonna make that worse?

110
00:10:52.138 --> 00:10:59.379
James Wade: Thinking about just these different objections? And then also the last one of yeah, this sounds nice. But am I really gonna just end up doing more work?

111
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:07.444
James Wade: And I gotta think about how to answer those. Well, I've kind of notes there, but you know it.

112
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.310
James Wade: yeah. So having some.

113
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:21.890
Articulation Coach: A thought, a thought just coming in right there, a thought that comes in my mind there is that that sounds like more work. You could do a comparison like you suggested.

114
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:28.210
Articulation Coach: But you could also just tell people, you know, like, if it really is more work for you, then don't take this approach.

115
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:29.940
James Wade: Okay.

116
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:38.149
Articulation Coach: Like you could say for me. I like shiny apps. It doesn't take me as much time, because I spend most of my time doing coding.

117
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.330
Articulation Coach: and Powerpoint is not a tool I use as often.

118
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.670
James Wade: Yep.

119
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:48.679
Articulation Coach: Right? So you could just acknowledge. That probably means you aren't, aren't actually the person.

120
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:52.636
James Wade: Good point.

121
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:59.949
Articulation Coach: And or the other one is is maybe it's slightly more work, but if it's more fun work it might go by faster

122
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.810
Articulation Coach: because you are talking to people where maybe the Powerpoint is not as fun.

123
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.090
James Wade: S.

124
00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.070
Articulation Coach: The other work.

125
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.410
James Wade: Powerpoint can be fun, too. Just different fun.

126
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:19.310
Articulation Coach: Yeah, I was in Powerpoint hell. Earlier today. I was, I was teaching while you were emailing me a brand new class.

127
00:12:21.844 --> 00:12:27.060
James Wade: So then I'm thinking of kind of going back into this. So

128
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:30.410
James Wade: a very brief recap of like.

129
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:43.840
James Wade: we have these new tools, you can use them. But emphasizing this, this idea, that's a mindset shift. Right? So it's not really asking you to learn something new. It's asking you to change your behavior and do something you already know how to do

130
00:12:44.193 --> 00:12:47.940
James Wade: and then kind of challenging them of like, you know.

131
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:53.860
James Wade: give it a try the next time you have your your next stakeholder meeting, surprise them with an app sort of thing.

132
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:54.580
Articulation Coach: Yeah.

133
00:12:55.887 --> 00:13:04.940
Articulation Coach: Outline structure, great James. And it really feels like it could fall in the timeframe. I have just a couple of things that might

134
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.199
Articulation Coach: just help tie it even more tightly together. For you.

135
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:16.270
Articulation Coach: 1st of all, I love the new mindset idea that you have at the beginning that one of the hardest things to do is actually going to be to change your mindset

136
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.139
Articulation Coach: about this, and that is great fun.

137
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:27.110
Articulation Coach: Let's see, we talked about the part you can't. Shortcut is also great.

138
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:34.229
Articulation Coach: You then, said the styling piece. You don't want to go into as much, because there's something later, right.

139
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.170
James Wade: Yep.

140
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.020
Articulation Coach: I mean, when you start narrating this, I would consider just saying it

141
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:44.000
Articulation Coach: like, cut all the styling, perhaps, and say.

142
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.880
James Wade: Okay.

143
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:54.100
Articulation Coach: And and just say, I'm you know I'm not going to talk about styling at all today, because there's some. There's a great talk coming later about it, or there's a talk coming in this session all about that

144
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:03.020
Articulation Coach: now, where I think you can save a little bit of smoothness, and time is

145
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.890
Articulation Coach: when you do the fun, demo with the cat chaos coordinator!

146
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.500
Articulation Coach: Hilarious!

147
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:16.280
Articulation Coach: Is it possible, as you go through the steps, to be walking us to that demo.

148
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:26.809
Articulation Coach: So when you get when you talk about, start with question, can you say so? Let's take an example. And you actually get us to the question that leads you to needing the

149
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.720
Articulation Coach: cat. Ks Coordinator.

150
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:29.920
James Wade: Yeah.

151
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.709
Articulation Coach: And then you show us a template that you chose, and then you do the style in seconds. So then step 4.

152
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.900
Articulation Coach: You've been doing it all along.

153
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.469
James Wade: I like it. Yeah.

154
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:54.409
Articulation Coach: It's more than who is hungry if we actually do the hard work of this question, though, because when I look at cuteness level and last petting time.

155
00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:03.420
Articulation Coach: It's the question's actually more. You know something about who needs me the most, or who will. I feel best. Having fed.

156
00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.190
James Wade: Yeah, yeah.

157
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.900
Articulation Coach: There's an interaction here. It's more complicated.

158
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:16.280
James Wade: Yeah, my kids did make an appearance in the

159
00:15:17.118 --> 00:15:27.309
James Wade: my last posit comp talk. So I that that can be a theme. And then 2 times ago they made me so. I missed because my wife went into labor so.

160
00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:32.910
Articulation Coach: I can't believe you were like like that. Would she go in particularly early into labor?

161
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:40.500
James Wade: Oh, yeah, she was super early, they were they. They were twins, and they, she didn't actually give birth. Then it was false labor. So yeah.

162
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.220
James Wade: it's a long story. But they they all. Everybody is great

163
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.869
James Wade: other than the you know. The the dogs didn't like all the new babies that we brought home so.

164
00:15:50.656 --> 00:15:51.433
Articulation Coach: No.

165
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:58.969
James Wade: The only I have very limited parenting advice. The only parenting I have. Advice, advice I have is, I have one child at a time.

166
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.879
Articulation Coach: And you can't.

167
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.899
Articulation Coach: Once that piece of advice.

168
00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.959
James Wade: Yeah, it's not in your control, but much like most of parenting.

169
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.810
Articulation Coach: Yeah.

170
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:18.959
Articulation Coach: that was the only place where I thought you could actually maybe save yourself a little bit of time and also smoothness by having us go along the cat app rather than teach us the steps. Then show us the steps. You just do it

171
00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:19.940
Articulation Coach: concurrently.

172
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.560
James Wade: Okay.

173
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:34.550
Articulation Coach: The objections I think you you nailed where the objections were. Objection? 2. I don't know if this is worth thinking about. But does this, reinforce your reminder of throw it away

174
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.889
Articulation Coach: like don't be like, if you choose, this approach. You do not want to become a hoarder.

175
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.350
James Wade: Yeah.

176
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:50.680
James Wade: people will laugh if I gave this internally, because I have way. Too many apps, even without the disposable aspect of.

177
00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:56.909
Articulation Coach: That is a funny moment when you you could even say I might be the wrong one to ask. Here.

178
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.339
Articulation Coach: I've been accused of being a hoarder of apps.

179
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:00.680
James Wade: Alright!

180
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.160
Articulation Coach: Yeah.

181
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:08.259
Articulation Coach: yeah, it's very.

182
00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:08.630
James Wade: Very clear.

183
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.950
Articulation Coach: Very clear structure. James and great Story.

184
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.069
James Wade: One thing.

185
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.049
James Wade: So I guess we were gonna talk about the hook as well right.

186
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:17.630
Articulation Coach: Yeah.

187
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:23.849
James Wade: So these were

188
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.400
James Wade: like

189
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:48.330
James Wade: these I've been. I've been brainstorming with one of the AI models on these to try to come up with a good one, and I I don't know that I've landed on it quite yet. I do like this. This is attention grabbing of like this of. I'm never gonna make slides for manager ever again. Sort of thing of like if they want something, I'm gonna make them an app.

190
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.660
James Wade: It's not quite true. So

191
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.060
James Wade: I don't know. It's still kind of fun.

192
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.600
James Wade: Then there's like this, the you know

193
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:05.429
James Wade: frustration that people often have of like you have you end up getting stuck in the minutia

194
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:15.820
James Wade: of the way that somebody's decided to display some data right? Like, you don't like the Graphic. And so you talk about what if we looked at it this way, like, okay, we'll just like, let's just start from an app, and then you can look at it. However, you want.

195
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.749
James Wade: That that's the part that I still wanna. I'm not sold on on these approaches quite yet.

196
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.350
Articulation Coach: What's the 3rd one? The analogy.

197
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:35.350
James Wade: So yeah, so it's this idea of like you you have. This

198
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.050
James Wade: painting is the analogy. And so, like you're you've been.

199
00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:53.449
James Wade: You spend all this time creating a painting, and then do you want to? And that's where you come and show. And then that's it right. And people are just staring that the painting is the slide, right? The slide doesn't move. And you you spend

200
00:18:53.836 --> 00:18:59.160
James Wade: trying to create something in somebody's mind. But instead, it's like you give them something that they create with you.

201
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:08.059
James Wade: which is not the the part that isn't quite right about it is they're not creating the app, but they now have something that they could explore along with you. So it's more of like a

202
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:14.110
James Wade: they're not necessarily creating, but they can. They can change it. So that's like the clay aspect of it.

203
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:15.720
Articulation Coach: Yeah. Yeah.

204
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:28.430
Articulation Coach: Well, the 1st thing I'm going to know is that especially for the last 2 hooks were the, did you? I'm gonna have to ask you later if you used AI to help you, because I'm really curious how people are using AI to help them with presentations.

205
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.770
James Wade: Sure. Yeah.

206
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.509
Articulation Coach: It reads like, just like the 1st part of it reads like, Oh, that's probably a prompt you gave.

207
00:19:35.396 --> 00:19:39.070
Articulation Coach: I can tell by your voice. You don't like the second 2,

208
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:49.599
Articulation Coach: so I think you get rid of them because you don't like them. So if you continue to use AI to help you use your gut instinct if you're like. I don't like it. Then it's not a hook

209
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:55.030
Articulation Coach: that will work on humans, especially if you're the person delivering it to humans.

210
00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:04.919
Articulation Coach: So we can X out those. I think there might be something to extend in the analogy. One, if you wanted to, which is more in the world of like a children's museum.

211
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:10.979
Articulation Coach: So in a museum for adults, you go in, you look at the paintings you observe, you appreciate.

212
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:19.009
Articulation Coach: and you take your kids to a kids museum. There's an exhibit. You touch, you play, you interact with it.

213
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.870
James Wade: Yeah, yeah.

214
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.829
Articulation Coach: And which place has more laughter.

215
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:29.460
Articulation Coach: I don't know right like which place is more fun. I don't know. Some people would still say the Museum, but they can keep using Powerpoint then.

216
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.239
Articulation Coach: so that could be a more apt analogy than the clay.

217
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.220
James Wade: Yeah, I like that.

218
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:42.789
Articulation Coach: And again it it you might have personal experience with that. So it's not quite so distant from you.

219
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:43.360
James Wade: Yep.

220
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:51.439
Articulation Coach: I also think there is something to the 1st one.

221
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:02.710
Articulation Coach: Have you ever had you ever been so frustrated by making a slide deck that you have thought I never want to do this again.

222
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.070
James Wade: Only every time I'm asked to make one against my will.

223
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:13.189
Articulation Coach: Well, then, you could mold what AI started to give you if you wanted.

224
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.580
Articulation Coach: That's right.

225
00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.539
Articulation Coach: True hook, which is a little more true to you, which is

226
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:21.230
Articulation Coach: the way you just expressed it to me.

227
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:26.770
Articulation Coach: Like. Every time I have to make a presentation my heart sinks.

228
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.780
Articulation Coach: I never want to open my Powerpoint again.

229
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.909
Articulation Coach: and that could be your kind of bold proclamation start

230
00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:43.459
Articulation Coach: now. AI was also overthinking it. Because you have a bold proclamation star already. If you scroll back up.

231
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:52.220
Articulation Coach: That's the only reason I'm hopeful that I won't ever lose my job is because AI can certainly give you stuff.

232
00:21:53.980 --> 00:22:00.740
Articulation Coach: So you actually have a bold proclamation in here. Your goal.

233
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:04.570
James Wade: Yeah.

234
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.730
Articulation Coach: And so you could start from there

235
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:28.219
Articulation Coach: and get into your talk much faster. And so maybe if you want something that like helps people attach to it. Then you could play with the word like throw like the throw them away you could play with, you know. I'm not somebody who believes in buying clothing that you're going to throw away. I'm not someone who believes in this that you throw away, but shiny apps. I'm willing to throw them away.

236
00:22:29.153 --> 00:22:32.140
Articulation Coach: and I'm gonna convince you to that. So

237
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.510
Articulation Coach: that could also be very simple. Hook.

238
00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.379
James Wade: I like that.

239
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.580
James Wade: I think that's I think that's gonna be stickier I think I'm the.

240
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:54.339
James Wade: I think I'm the definitely on day 2. I forget if I'm in the morning or the afternoon. But people are already, like, you know.

241
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:58.429
James Wade: sold on all things data, science by then, so like they don't need

242
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:06.829
James Wade: you get pickier. I get pickier towards the end of the of conference to what talks I'm actually going to go to. And maybe I'm gonna go like chat with people instead of go to a talk. So.

243
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.790
James Wade: The audience is usually more bought in.

244
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.830
Articulation Coach: You're in the shiny section, right of the day.

245
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:20.019
James Wade: It's like there's Chinese things. I forget exactly what the section is.

246
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.740
Articulation Coach: It's okay.

247
00:23:21.116 --> 00:23:24.820
James Wade: It's not like. It's not the the like

248
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.030
James Wade: where the shiny well, there is a shiny team member presenting in mind. But it's not where all the shiny team members are presenting.

249
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:30.820
Articulation Coach: Okay.

250
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:45.880
Articulation Coach: Well, Matt, I mean, if if you like that, I think that, or going with the detritus of the either, the thing is the things that they gave you is in the analogy section. If you scroll down to what they gave you.

251
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.560
James Wade: Yep.

252
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:54.159
Articulation Coach: If you have time, or as you're going through the talk, you feel like, boy. I've just been talking all app for a little bit.

253
00:23:54.520 --> 00:24:10.869
Articulation Coach: and haven't been having much fun with my audience. Well, you have some great options here that could be put in places, so the analogy piece can be put in the section where you're talking about. Why, an app instead of a presentation. It's just a metaphor that fits there. It's not a hook.

254
00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:12.270
James Wade: Sure.

255
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.309
Articulation Coach: In that case.

256
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.410
James Wade: Yeah.

257
00:24:16.522 --> 00:24:21.250
Articulation Coach: Similar to the the bold, the you saying, I I

258
00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:27.819
Articulation Coach: I never want to make a Powerpoint deck again. That could just be an aside. That's happening

259
00:24:28.641 --> 00:24:33.409
Articulation Coach: at some point in the talk. So there's there's value in what they gave you. I'm just not sure.

260
00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:35.800
James Wade: Okay.

261
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:41.080
Articulation Coach: And I will tell you my my personal taste is that the raise your hand? If, as a start to a talk.

262
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.210
Articulation Coach: it's gotta be really good, because so many people.

263
00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:46.327
James Wade: I've done it.

264
00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:52.905
Articulation Coach: Right. You've been in a lot of talks that immediately ask you to raise your hand. You're like, we just started.

265
00:24:54.304 --> 00:24:54.609
Articulation Coach: Yeah.

266
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.330
James Wade: Earned my participation, yet.

267
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.432
Articulation Coach: No, I don't even know you yet. You asked me to raise my hand.

268
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.589
Articulation Coach: I've used it so. I can point fingers all I want, because I do it too.

269
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.450
Articulation Coach: Does that help you to kind of make your way through what you might want to use as a hook.

270
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.919
James Wade: Yeah, I think so I like this, I like just jumping right in because I think

271
00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:19.440
James Wade: I think people will get it. And they're gonna be like.

272
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.690
James Wade: I think they'll get to the. So tell me more part pretty quick

273
00:25:25.186 --> 00:25:28.279
James Wade: where they're ready to just kind of hear like what I actually have to say.

274
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:34.160
Articulation Coach: Yep, what you will probably need if you want to put a sub bullet right after your stated goal.

275
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:44.300
Articulation Coach: you're gonna because you just made a bold proclamation. We're gonna need something that lets us know a little bit about your perspective and who you are. I don't

276
00:25:44.640 --> 00:26:07.759
Articulation Coach: include that you work for Dow, but it might be more along the lines of you loving, shiny apps. It might be about like the thing I said about not throwing other things. You don't throw everything away, but you throw these things away. We just need a moment to feel like, why is this person trustworthy for me to keep listening after that bold proclamation.

277
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.170
James Wade: Yeah, I could say something of like, you know, I have

278
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:21.300
James Wade: a 2 year old shiny app that has like 500 users, right? Or something like, I don't know something of, like, Yeah, I I built these things that I've had to be stuck maintaining.

279
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.780
James Wade: Yeah.

280
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:29.679
Articulation Coach: Yeah, something in that world. So that they're like, yeah, this is like, this is the guy. He's done it both ways.

281
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.010
Articulation Coach: Yeah, that's all it needs. There.

282
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:36.630
Articulation Coach: it's great.

283
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:37.310
James Wade: Okay.

284
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:45.590
Articulation Coach: Can I ask, like, what kind of prompts you were using to get AI to help you organize everything? What did you give it.

285
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:52.719
James Wade: Yeah. So so what I did was, I did a draft of my outline and then I actually took the recording

286
00:26:53.267 --> 00:27:06.149
James Wade: that you had shared, and I, Jim, and I can now take the recording. That's be less than an hour. So I had to trim the video down a little bit. I gave it my abstract, and then my pitch to for the talk itself, and I was like.

287
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.790
James Wade: help me with the hook. Right! Tell, break, break some of this down.

288
00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:17.160
James Wade: Actually, no, I said, improve the outline and give me some hooks for this, literally giving it the instructions that we had.

289
00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.650
Articulation Coach: For the session.

290
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:28.620
Articulation Coach: Oh, I'm glad our instructions got you this, I mean, how much did you have to do after AI took over? Did you have to come and just kind of fluff it around and.

291
00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:36.810
James Wade: I wish I could just show you this. My, I'm on my work computer right now. And it's blocked on on my work computer. But my personal computer doesn't have those issues.

292
00:27:37.521 --> 00:27:39.560
James Wade: Yeah, it's pretty easy like you. Just

293
00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.639
James Wade: no, the the models are getting quite good. So.

294
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:43.790
Articulation Coach: Wow!

295
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.320
Articulation Coach: I'm both excited and terrified by that.

296
00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:48.190
Articulation Coach: I'm excited.

297
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.920
James Wade: Yeah, well.

298
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.940
Articulation Coach: I'm excited because our prompts were right.

299
00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:53.250
James Wade: Like.

300
00:27:53.950 --> 00:28:02.220
Articulation Coach: It got you like it got you where you needed to go, and that the recording was one of the things that also helped was the discussion, and the people part because I.

301
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:02.630
James Wade: Don't think.

302
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.850
Articulation Coach: I. Personally, I have a bias, but I don't think that there will.

303
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:17.769
Articulation Coach: You will ever be able to get people out of a good preparation for a verbal communication, because ultimately the audience is people. And AI just can't get you all the way there.

304
00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:26.349
James Wade: Oh, sure, yeah, same thing of yeah. Creators of all sorts are are trying to figure out what to do with all this stuff, right? And.

305
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.010
Articulation Coach: Yeah.

306
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.650
James Wade: People like people.

307
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.453
James Wade: So that's.

308
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:44.550
Articulation Coach: But that's so helpful like I mean, I'm going to be telling my colleagues right after this call. Oh, my gosh! So I just talked to somebody. He told me what he did. He used the recording, which will be very exciting to all of us. Very cool.

309
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.299
Articulation Coach: And, James, I think you've got a really good talk on your hands, entertaining.

310

James Wade: Awesome.

James Wade: Disposal.

313
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.139
